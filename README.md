# DSCL-EXP-04-POINTERS
Short Description: This C program initializes an integer variable x with the value 2, declares a pointer variable p that points to x, and then prints the values of x, &x, *p, &p, and p.

Algorithm:

Declare an integer variable x with the value 2. Declare an integer pointer variable p and assign it the address of x. Print the value of x using the %d format specifier. Print the address of x using the %d format specifier and the & operator. Print the value of *p, which is the value pointed to by p, using the %d format specifier and the * operator. Print the address of p using the %d format specifier and the & operator. Print the value of p using the %d format specifier. Output: When this program is executed, it will print the values of x, &x, *p, &p, and p on a single line, separated by whitespace. The output will be as follows:
